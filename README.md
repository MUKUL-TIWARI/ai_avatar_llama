🧠 AI Avatar LLaMA

An interactive AI-powered avatar that listens, speaks, and moves its mouth using real-time voice and lip-sync animation — powered by LLaMA, MoviePy, OpenCV, and text-to-speech technologies.

🌟 Features

🎤 Voice Input — Speak to your AI avatar directly using a microphone

💬 LLaMA Model — Generates intelligent, human-like responses

🗣️ Voice Output — The avatar replies using realistic text-to-speech

🧏 Lip-Sync Animation — Mouth movement synced with generated audio

🧍 Custom Avatar — Add your own image or animated character face

⚙️ Modular Design — Easy to extend and improve

🧩 Tech Stack

AI Model	Meta LLaMA
Voice Recognition	speech_recognition
Text-to-Speech	pyttsx3 or gTTS
Avatar Animation	MoviePy, OpenCV
Backend Logic	Python
Environment	Local (can be deployed on Flask later)

⚙️ Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/mukultiwari/ai-avatar-llama.git
cd ai-avatar-llama

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the Avatar
python main.py

🧠 How It Works

The program listens to your voice input

It sends your speech to the LLaMA model for generating a response

The AI’s text response is converted into speech

The avatar’s mouth moves in sync with the generated audio
